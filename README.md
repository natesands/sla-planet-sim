# sla-planet-sim (WORK IN PROGRESS)
Simulating the birth of planets using semi-Lagrangian advection.

Based on the research and code contained in 
SIMULATING THE BIRTH OF PLANETS: A SPECTRAL SEMI-LAGRANGIAN HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH,
a Master's thesis by Wendy Crumrine. Code ported to C from MATLAB for parallelization.
