# sla-planet-sim
Simulating the birth of planets using semi-Lagrangian advection and spectral methods.

Based on the research and code contained in 
SIMULATING THE BIRTH OF PLANETS: A SPECTRAL SEMI-LAGRANGIAN HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH,
a Master's thesis by Wendy Crumrine. Code ported to C from MATLAB for parallelization.

## Introduction
Planetary formation takes place in a disc of dust and gas rotating around a star.  How planets grow from meter-sized boulders to kilometer-sized planetessimals is still a mystery, as our current models suggest that drag forces within the gas should cause these relatively small bodies to spiral into the star.  

In this project we address the so-called "meter-sized gap problem" by modeling gas and dust as fluids, using a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian dynamics.  A key component to our approach is quantifying the vorticity of the gas and dust at every point in our sample space.  The underlying model includes five PDE's which are solved using spectral methods.

## Installation
**CAVEAT COMPILER** : This implementation currently has a bad memory leak (easy fix, but time is short).

The code requires installation of fftw3 (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) for FFTs and gsl (GNU scientific library) for interpolation.   It can be compiled within the `c` directory using `gcc -o sla sla.c fft.c -lfftw3 -lgsl -lm`.

To set the box size and number of time steps, adjust values of NX, NY, and NT in the macro definitions in `sla.h`.

The compiled program currently prints out a line of NX x NY floating points representing the grids value of rho (dust density) in row-major order.



## Profile
(Coming soon)

## TODOs
*  Fix memory leak.
*  Profile code.
*  Parallelize DFTs and interpolations.
*  Install on CARC discovery cluster
*  Explain discrepancies between c port model and MATLAB model.
