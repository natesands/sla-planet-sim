Stuff to ask Wendy about:
-- Assumption of ideal gas properties
-- what is the nature of the error introduced when derivatives are imported back from Fourier space?
-- Elimination of diffuse dust flow

General questions:
-- Can we make any assumptions about initial conditions other than simple noise?
-- Is there any room in the model to introduce gravitational effects (other than from the star) when dust reaches critical density?
-- How do we deal with periodic boundary conditions?  (This is a basic question addressed in molecular dynamics simulations and there must be a lot of literature on it.)


TODO:
-- Fix Z's malloc invalid size unsorted error
-- set up profiling
